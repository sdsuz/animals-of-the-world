<p>"Koalas typically inhabit open eucalyptus woodland, the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep upto 20 hours a day.  They are asocial animals and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring.  Adult males communicate with loud bellows that imitate rivals and attact mates.  Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands  located on their chests. Being marsupials , koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mother's pouches where they stay for the next six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but they are threatened by various pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the Koala retrovirus."

    "Because of its distinct appearance, the Koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia.  They were hunted by indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia.  The first recorded encounter between a European and a Koala was in 1798 and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed  detailed dcientific description of the Koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years."</p>
