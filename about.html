        <h2>  The Koala's Habitat Loss from Australia's Devastating 2019-2020 Bushfires   </h2>
    <! --this is a subheading -->          
    <p> The World Wildlife Fund documents Australia's most extreme bushfires in recent times. They reported: "It's been a year we'll never forget. Even before the challenges of COVID-19, Australia was hit hard by bushfires during summer 2019-20 the most catastrophic bushfire season ever experienced in the country's history. So much was lost and the impacts will be felt for years to come." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> 
        "Up to 19 million hectares were burnt, with 12.6 million hectares primarily forest and bushland. 33 lives were lost and around 3,094 homes destroyed." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> 
        "Early in January, WWF estimated that at that time, 1.25 billion animals had been killed.  As the fires raged well into March, and destroyed even more habitat, we had a scientific duty to update that figure to understand the true impact on our wildlife and natural landscapes." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "An interim report was released six months on from the fires that we commissioned from a team of scientists from Australian universities, and the findings are shocking.  Nearly 3 billion animals were impacted by the bush fires."
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "At the peak of the fires, our focus was to get emergency support to the amazing frontline organisations, rescuing and caring for injured and fire-affected wildlife." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Now that the fires are out, it's time to focus on the long road to recovery and future-proofing our country for the fire seasons ahead." 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        "As we grapple with the global pandemic, the need for our work does not stop. In fact, nature needs us now more than ever."
